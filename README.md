# Chip-8 Emulator

This is a implementation of an Chip-8 Emulator using C++. I have written this implementation to learn how emulators work.

The rendering is done using the Mantaray Library (https://github.com/nicohirsau/Mantaray), but the emulator itself is completely independent and could be used with any rendering method.

A download of a build can be found here: https://nico-preuss.com/downloads/manta8.zip

To start the emulator with a game, just drag an ROM over the executable file in the windows explorer.
